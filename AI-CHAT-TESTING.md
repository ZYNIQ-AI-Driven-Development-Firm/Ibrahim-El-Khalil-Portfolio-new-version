# AI Chat Testing Guide

## ✅ Fix Applied

The Gemini API key has been successfully baked into the frontend build! 

**What was fixed:**
1. Updated `frontend/Dockerfile` to copy `.env` file during build
2. Rebuilt frontend with `--no-cache` to ensure environment variables are included
3. Verified API key is present in JavaScript bundle

## Testing Steps

### 1. Open the Portfolio
Go to: **http://localhost:3000/portfolio**

### 2. Locate the AI Chat Button
Look for the "CHAT" button on the right side of the screen:
- It should appear as a vertical tab with a bot icon
- Text should read "CHAT" vertically
- When you hover, it shows "Chat with AI" tooltip

### 3. Open the Chat
Click the CHAT button to open the AI assistant window

### 4. Test the Chat
Try these test messages:

**Test 1: Basic Introduction**
```
Hi, who are you?
```
Expected: AI should introduce itself as Ibrahim El Khalil's assistant

**Test 2: Experience Query**
```
Tell me about Ibrahim's experience
```
Expected: AI should list his work experience, mentioning ZYNIQ and other roles

**Test 3: Skills Query**
```
What technologies does Ibrahim work with?
```
Expected: AI should mention his tech stack (Python, FastAPI, React, etc.)

**Test 4: Projects Query**
```
What are his key projects?
```
Expected: AI should describe his ventures and projects

**Test 5: Contact Query**
```
How can I contact Ibrahim?
```
Expected: AI should mention LinkedIn, email options available on the portfolio

### 5. Check for Errors

**In Browser Console (F12):**
- ✅ Should NOT see: "Gemini API key is missing"
- ✅ Should NOT see: "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to the AI service"
- ✅ Should see streaming responses from the AI

**In Chat Window:**
- ✅ Messages should appear smoothly with typewriter effect
- ✅ AI responses should be relevant to the portfolio
- ✅ No error messages in chat

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting..."

1. **Check API Key in Bundle:**
   ```powershell
   docker exec portfolio_frontend sh -c "cat /usr/share/nginx/html/static/js/main.*.js | grep AIzaSy | head -1"
   ```
   Should show: `AIzaSyBFfs_RSxeXWi6gsI-rV_T3w9bFT7I9Aac`

2. **Check Browser Console:**
   Press F12 and look for error messages
   - Red errors indicate API issues
   - Look for "Gemini" or "API" in error messages

3. **Verify API Key is Valid:**
   - Go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   - Verify the key `AIzaSyBFfs_RSxeXWi6gsI-rV_T3w9bFT7I9Aac` is active
   - Check if there are quota limits or restrictions

4. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Open F12 → Network tab
   - Try sending a chat message
   - Look for requests to `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
   - If blocked, check CORS or firewall settings

### If API Key is Invalid

1. Get a new API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

2. Update both `.env` files:
   ```
   # Root .env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_key_here
   
   # frontend/.env
   REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_key_here
   ```

3. Rebuild frontend:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\Preview Lab\OneDrive\Desktop\New Projects\Khalil Preview Portfolio\Ibrahim-El-Khalil-Portfolio-new-version"
   docker-compose stop frontend
   docker-compose rm -f frontend
   docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
   docker-compose up -d frontend
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Working Correctly:
- Chat button appears on right side
- Clicking opens chat window
- AI responds to messages within 2-3 seconds
- Responses are relevant to Ibrahim's portfolio
- Markdown formatting works (bold, lists, etc.)
- Voice mode button visible (microphone icon)
- Predefined suggestions work

### ❌ Not Working:
- Error message: "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to the AI service"
- No response after 10+ seconds
- Generic/irrelevant responses
- Chat window doesn't open
- Console errors about API key

## Additional Features to Test

### Voice Mode (Optional)
1. Click microphone icon in chat header
2. Icon should turn purple when enabled
3. Click microphone in input field to start listening
4. Speak your question
5. AI response should be read aloud

### Suggestions
1. Hover over input field
2. Start typing partial text (e.g., "Tell me")
3. Suggestions should appear below input
4. Click a suggestion to use it

### Conversation Context
1. Ask: "What's Ibrahim's experience?"
2. Then ask: "What about his education?"
3. AI should maintain context and understand "his" refers to Ibrahim

## Success Criteria

✅ **The AI Chat is working if:**
- Messages send successfully
- AI responds within 5 seconds
- Responses are relevant to portfolio
- No error messages appear
- Conversation flows naturally

## Need Help?

If issues persist:
1. Check `GEMINI-API-SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting
2. Verify all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
3. Check frontend logs: `docker-compose logs frontend`
4. Restart all containers: `docker-compose restart`
